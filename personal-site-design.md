 What is you site's primary purpose?
    The short term objective for this site is to use it as a journal for my learning on web development here at EDA. I will be implementing my HTML and CSS skills as I'm learning during the foundation.     
 
 Who is your target audience?
    Anyone who has access to EDA slack channel including teachers and students.
 
 How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
    I want the audience to see my learning journey. This means, where I can, I will leave some parts of the page untouched as I develop my skill. Maybe I can measure my development this way. I love playing with web design materials eventhough I may lack design skills. I like to have an engaging and attractive looking webpage. I would like my visitors to have a good user experience when visiting my site.   
 
 How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
    I have started learning about wireframe. So, moving forward, I will probably start my design with wireframe. For now, I will more likely to be using twitter bootstrap framework while I can slowly add behaviour to my page later on using javascript.
